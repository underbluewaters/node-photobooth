# INITIAL SETUP
# enter the mongo shell
mongo
# connect to the database
use photobooth
# remove any old test photos
db.sessions.remove()

# remove any old test photos
rm node-photobooth/transfer/public/pdf
rm node-photobooth/transfer/public/snaps

make sure all iphones, ipads, etc are unplugged!!! These mess with gphoto2

# order probably doesn't matter, but be wary
plug in camera
plug in controller

make sure controller is sending signal using arduino application or screen

set usb device appropriately as necessary
coffee app.coffee

App is at http://localhost:3000

# TROUBLESHOOTING

So far no re-occuring problems. If one occurs

1) Open the shell using the eject key on the keypad. See any errors in the terminal from the node process
2) Try to reboot using:
  coffee app.coffee
  this command must be run from /Users/cburt/Working/node-photobooth/
  
CHECK CONTROLLER

open Arduino (Mac App), got to Tools -> Serial Monitor and look for output when pressing buttons

if that doesn't work, quit Arduino. Unplug, then plug it in. Restart Arduino and try again. If that works, quit Arduino (it hogs the serial port), and restart the app using `coffee app.coffee` in the terminal.

CHECK THE CAMERA

try this from anywhere in Terminal
gphoto2 --capture-image

if that doesn't work the camera isn't operational. Restart procedure:
1) unplug
2) check power, turn off/on camera, etc
3) plug back in
4) press the shutter button to make the connection between the computer/camera
5) in terminal, type `killall PTPCamera`
6) try the above gphoto2 command again

Make sure no ipads, iphones, etc are plugged in!!!!! Gphoto is very robust, except against this.


BROWSER AND ANIMATIONS ARE SLOW

Close all Safari windows and restart Safari. Maybe try chrome if that doesn't work. Fullscreen can be entered/exited like any other Lion app.

COUNTDOWN OUT OF SYNC

See above. Countdown will never be super-super accurate. Inconsistency is due to autofocus lag.
